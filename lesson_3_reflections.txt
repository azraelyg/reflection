1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all 
your work local?
When multiple people are working on a same project. Or I want to access 
the project remotely.

2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I might want to choose what changes I want to pull from the remote 
repository instead of every change.

3.Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would 
you use one instead of another?
'fork' is to copy a repo to github of your account
'clones' is to download repo on github or local to local
'branches' is to create another path for the same repo
