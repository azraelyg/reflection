1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all 
your work local?
When multiple people are working on a same project. Or I want to access 
the project remotely.

2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I might want to choose what changes I want to pull from the remote 
repository instead of every change.
